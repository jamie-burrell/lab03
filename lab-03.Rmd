# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
wide format variable have their own column and normally many columns represent the same variables in different time or condition
long format means data was managed by two colmuns and one colmun means its name and another is value,eg: income data will distinguish datas by year and income,so different year income will show in many rows

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?




How many observations are there in the data set?




## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- ___ %>%
#  ___(
#    cols = ____, 
#    names_to = "_____",
#    values_to = "percent"
#    )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here
